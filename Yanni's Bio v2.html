            <p>
                Born in Ohio, where I've lived most of my life.  Lived in Greece for nine years when I was young.  Studied Aerospace at Embry-Riddle<br/>
                but transferred to Kent State, where I received my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering Technology.  I worked for a few years at Goodyear and<br/>
                Bridgestone/Firestone doing Mold Design using CAD.  Then I went to Boston to study Theology.  I received my M.Div. from Holy Cross Greek<br/>
                Orthodox School of Theology.  I was ordained as a priest in 2005 and have been serving the Greek Orthodox Church in America for 13 years.<br/>
                I have served in four different church communities.  I'm taking a little break from the ministry to pursue coding.  I am married, have<br/>
                five children and love playing soccer and reading.  I also like video games.
